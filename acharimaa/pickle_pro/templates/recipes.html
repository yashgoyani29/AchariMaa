        <p class="card-text">Mango pickle is not just tasty  it can also help your skin glow when eaten in moderation. This traditional Indian food is made using raw mangoes, mustard seeds, oil, salt, and spices like turmeric, all of which offer health benefits.</p>
        <p><span class="highlights">Raw mango</span> is rich in Vitamin C, which helps in boosting collagen. <span class="highlights">Collagen</span> keeps your skin firm, smooth, and glowing.</p>
        <p><span class="highlights">Turmeric</span> is known for its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties. It helps reduce acne and soothes the skin from the inside out.</p>
        <p><span class="highlights">Mustard seeds</span> and <span class="highlights">mustard oil</span> are full of antioxidants and healthy fats. These flush out toxins and keep skin moisturized and soft.</p>
        <p>Pickle also aids <span class="highlights">digestion</span> due to natural fermentation. A healthy stomach means fewer skin issues like pimples and dullness.</p>
        <p class="text-danger">Tip: Don’t overeat. Too much salt and oil can be harmful. A spoonful a day with meals is ideal.</p>
